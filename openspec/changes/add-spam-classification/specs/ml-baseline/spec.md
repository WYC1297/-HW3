# ML Baseline Capability

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: SVM Model Implementation
The system SHALL implement a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier as the baseline model for spam detection.

#### Scenario: SVM model creation
- **WHEN** the baseline model is initialized
- **THEN** the system creates an SVM classifier with appropriate hyperparameters

#### Scenario: Model training
- **WHEN** training data is provided to the SVM model
- **THEN** the system trains the classifier on the preprocessed features

### Requirement: Model Training
The system SHALL train the SVM model using the preprocessed training dataset.

#### Scenario: Training process execution
- **WHEN** the SVM model training is initiated
- **THEN** the system fits the model to the training data and completes without errors

#### Scenario: Training convergence
- **WHEN** the training process completes
- **THEN** the model converges and produces stable predictions

### Requirement: Model Evaluation
The system SHALL evaluate the trained SVM model performance using standard metrics.

#### Scenario: Performance metrics calculation
- **WHEN** the trained model is evaluated on test data
- **THEN** the system calculates accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

#### Scenario: Confusion matrix generation
- **WHEN** model predictions are analyzed
- **THEN** the system generates a confusion matrix showing true/false positives and negatives

### Requirement: Model Persistence
The system SHALL save and load trained models for future use.

#### Scenario: Model saving
- **WHEN** the SVM model training is completed
- **THEN** the system saves the trained model to disk in a standard format

#### Scenario: Model loading
- **WHEN** a saved model is needed for predictions
- **THEN** the system loads the model and restores its trained state

### Requirement: Prediction Interface
The system SHALL provide an interface for making spam classifications on new SMS messages.

#### Scenario: Single message prediction
- **WHEN** a new SMS message is provided to the trained model
- **THEN** the system returns a spam/ham classification with confidence score

#### Scenario: Batch prediction
- **WHEN** multiple SMS messages are provided
- **THEN** the system returns classifications for all messages in the batch
