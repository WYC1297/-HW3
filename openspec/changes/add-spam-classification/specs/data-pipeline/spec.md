# Data Pipeline Capability

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Data Acquisition
The system SHALL download and store the SMS spam dataset from the specified remote source.

#### Scenario: Download dataset
- **WHEN** data acquisition is initiated
- **THEN** the system downloads the CSV file from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-On-Artificial-Intelligence-for-Cybersecurity/refs/heads/master/Chapter03/datasets/sms_spam_no_header.csv

#### Scenario: Data integrity verification
- **WHEN** the dataset is downloaded
- **THEN** the system verifies the file is accessible and contains expected SMS data

### Requirement: Data Loading
The system SHALL load and parse the SMS spam dataset for processing.

#### Scenario: Load CSV data
- **WHEN** the dataset file is loaded
- **THEN** the system parses the CSV and creates a structured data format

#### Scenario: Data structure validation
- **WHEN** data is loaded
- **THEN** the system validates that spam/ham labels and message text are present

### Requirement: Data Preprocessing
The system SHALL preprocess text data for machine learning model training.

#### Scenario: Text cleaning
- **WHEN** raw SMS messages are preprocessed
- **THEN** the system removes special characters, normalizes text, and handles encoding

#### Scenario: Feature extraction
- **WHEN** cleaned text is processed
- **THEN** the system converts text to numerical features suitable for ML models

### Requirement: Data Splitting
The system SHALL split the dataset into training and testing portions.

#### Scenario: Train-test split
- **WHEN** the dataset is prepared for modeling
- **THEN** the system splits data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets

#### Scenario: Stratified sampling
- **WHEN** data is split
- **THEN** the system maintains the original spam/ham ratio in both training and test sets
