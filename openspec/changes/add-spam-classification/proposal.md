# Add Spam Email Classification System

## Why
Create a machine learning-based spam email classification system to demonstrate practical ML application development. This project serves as homework assignment (HW3) showcasing end-to-end ML pipeline development from data acquisition to interactive web interface.

## What Changes
- **Phase 0**: Set up isolated Python environment using virtualenv (named "HW3")
- **Phase 1**: Download SMS spam dataset and implement SVM baseline model
- **Future Phases**: Additional ML models and Streamlit interface (to be defined)

## Impact
- Affected specs: New capabilities for `environment-setup`, `data-pipeline`, and `ml-baseline`
- Affected code: New Python modules for data processing, ML models, and web interface
- No breaking changes (entirely new project)
- Establishes foundation for multi-phase ML project development
